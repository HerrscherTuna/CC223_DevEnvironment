This API is a basic authentication system built with Node.js, Express, and JWT. Users can register and log in, with passwords securely hashed using bcrypt. After logging in, users get a JWT token to access protected routes. A middleware checks the token before allowing access to secure endpoints. Thereâ€™s an example `/api/protected` route that shows a welcome message for authenticated users.

It also includes a **Product Services Microservice** for managing product data. It lets you retrieve, add, update, and delete products. The microservice works independently, follows RESTful principles, and is easy to integrate with other systems. Sensitive endpoints are protected, so only authorized users can make changes. This setup is scalable and works well for e-commerce or inventory systems.
